## The Challenge

Regional Health Network, serving over 500,000 patients across 12 facilities, was struggling with a patchwork of legacy systems that hindered patient care and operational efficiency. Their 20-year-old electronic health records (EHR) system was creating bottlenecks, leading to longer patient wait times, administrative inefficiencies, and compliance concerns.

### Critical Issues
- **System Fragmentation**: 15+ disconnected systems requiring manual data entry
- **Performance Problems**: 45-second average load times for patient records
- **Compliance Risks**: Outdated security measures and audit trail gaps
